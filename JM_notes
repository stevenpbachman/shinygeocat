WORK DONE

#udpated POWO search to trap when you have no results, ugly but works
#tweak map size to be same as left panel

WORK NEEDED
HIGH
# User editable, moveable, delete point etc
# a.	geocat_id = an internal ID which is populated on import (ie 1:nrow), new points will be added to this with a nrow + _leaflet_id (_leaflet_id is a unique number from leaflet) this should allow me to use this id to query all on map edits/delete. The reason for odd allocation is that leaflet assigns its own unique values and I can’t find a way to update (read only), there is a possibility of a clash if,  I just increment ID and I may have get back out the leaflet ID as some point (not sure I do). I may simplify this later.
#b.	geo_status = a record of what has happen to a point ie “new point”, “moved point”, “deleted point”
#c.	geocat_use = Flag to false it point is deleted (could query on above, but I feel this is quicker)?
#d.	geocat_analysis = Flag for any queries (ie GBIF only etc), which we can switch on or off depending on reactive # elements (ie your switches for GBIF/user)

#GBIF query

MEDIUM
#Split polygon when over date line
# add suggestted IUCN ratings linked to EOO and AOO values
# return the projection used to the user?
#colour points by data_source

LOW
# POWO search which returns nothing, need to inform user in the information box to the left (where steve reports missing values)
# POWO search clear off old searches (maybe a button)
# Map to reproduce over date line (ie not say map data not available)
